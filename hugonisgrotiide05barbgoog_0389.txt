384 DE FIDE simonem POTESTATUM [Lm. nt

11. Est autem in horum promissis duplex inspectio: nam

aut hoc quaeritur, an summam potestatem obligent, aut an se
ιιιἰ ι ιι. ipsos. aPrior quaestio definienda est ex eo, quod alibi diximus,
'¹ obligari nos et per eum quem voluntatis nostrae ministrnm
elegerimus, sive voluutas illa specialiter expressa est, sire ex
ipss praepositionis natura colligitur. Nam qui dat saadu-
> ἰ tem, dat quantum in se est qum ad facultatem sunt necessaria,
quod sn materia morali intelligendum est morali modo. Duo-
bus ergo modis potestat es minores supremam suo lacto obstrin-
gunt, faciendo id quod probabiliter ipsorum officio contineri
censetur, autetiam extra illud ex speciali praepositioue nota

publice, aut iis quorum res agitur.

111. ’ Sunt etalii modo, quibus potestas summa obligatur
antecedente ministrorum lacto, sed uon ita, ut id sactum eausa·
sit proprie dicta, sed ut occasio sit obligationis: idque dupli·
citer, vel per consensum, vel per rem ipsam. consensus ap·
paret ratihabitione, non tantum expressa, sed et tacita, id est,

quae ad aliam causam relerri probabiliter uon possunt3 quod

11. The promises ol Officers of this kind gire rise ιο ιιιο kinds οι·
considerationes Whether they biud the supreme authoritys and
whether they bind themselves. The former question is to be decidcd
by what we hare said; that we are bound hy his acts whom we hare

ι selected as the minister· of our will, whether that will be specially
expressed, or be collected from the nature of the command committed
to him. For he who gives the means of actiug, gives, as iar as
depende ou him, the means which are necessary to such action: which,
in moral matters, is to be understood in c moral manner. Therelore
there are two ways in which subordinate authorities hind the
supreme authority by their acts: either by doing that which, on pro·
bable grounds is conceived to be included in their office3 or beyond
that, committed to them by some special assignmeut of authority,
known to those whose interests are dealt with.

111. There are also other ways in which the supreme authority
isbound, iu virtue of an antecedent aet of its ministare, bnt so that
that act is not, properly speaking, tho cause of the obligation, but the
occasion ; and that, in two we5s; either hy consent ot the superior,
or by the thing itself. consent appears by sanction oi the act3 not
express only, but tacit als03 that is, when the supreme authority knew
