4 But those persons are more praised who, giving up their right,
took no part of the booty to themselves3 like Fabricius, of whom 1
have spoken, Wlso ia te loce os oleru pat aeide even joe puin, as Dio·

- nysius says3 which he said he did according to the example of Vale·
rius Publicola, and a few others. And thcse, M. Porcius. Cato also
imitated inhia Spanish victory3 asserting that nothing should come
to him t‘rom the spoils of wer, except what he had spent in meat
sud drinkr adding however, that he did not blame the generals who
had accepted the advantages usually granted3 but that he would rather
oontend for the prize of virtue with the best, than for the pre-emi·
nence in wealch with the richest. Nearcst ιο this praise come those
who have tehen ιο themselves a moderate share of the prise-trea-
sures as Pompey in Lucan is praised by Cato, lor haring giren up
more than he kept.

ο In the division, there is sometimes account tulten of those who
have been absent3 as Fabius Ambustus directed when Anxur was
taken. And sometimes t'or seruc special reason account is not taken
ol some of those who were presentes of the tlinutinn nrrny, by the
