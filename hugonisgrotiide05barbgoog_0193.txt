XVII. But other rules than this may be established by civil
Laws ss by the Spnnish law, ships beeorrm theirs who regaiu mem
from pirates3 nor it is not unreasonablo that private iutercsts should
yield to public utility; especially, the difficulty of recovery being so
great But sacha law does not prevent stmngem from trying to
reoover what is theiis.

xum 1 Itis more remarkable, that, as the Roman usn testify,
the right of postliminium had place, not only between cuemioe, but
between the Romans and foreign notione. But, as ve have elsewhere
said, these traits were relicks of the nomade age oi mankind, in which
burbnrous manners had blnntcd the natural sense oi the natural
society which ought to bind men to men. And thus, eren between
natione which had not a public war between them, there was a kind of
licence oi private undcclared war: und in order that this licenee might
netgo to the length of putting strangers to death, there vas intro-
duced a right of making prisoncrs between nations3 from which it

· followed, that there was also occasion for postliminium, in a different
wey than with robbers and pirates3 because thet force, used in such cases,
led to fair compacts3 which are commonly held in no regard by robbers
aud pirates.
