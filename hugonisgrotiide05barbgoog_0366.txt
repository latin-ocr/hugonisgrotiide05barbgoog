sunt efficere, ut in principalium interpretatione a regula reee-
datur: ejus autem naturam et ipsa sequi debent

Lv111. Obiter hoc addendum est, obsides interdum non
accessionem esse obligationis, sed resera partem principalem:
ut cum quis ex contractu sactum promittit non suum, et quia,
co non praestito, tenetur ad id quod interest, ejus ricc obsides
obligantur: quam subse rideri seutentiam Caudinae sponsionis
diximus alibi. Non dura tantum, sed et iniqua cst sententia gig-¹1¹&
existimantium, obsides etiam sinc consensu suo alterum ex gemit
facto alterius posse obligari.

LIX. Pignora quaedam communia habeut cum obsidibus,
quadam propria. Commune, quod et ex alio jam debito re·
timentur, nisi obstet data fides: proprium, qnod quse de iis
est pactio, non tarn stricte sumitur, quam illa de obsidibus:
noque enim aequale estodium. Res enim natae suut, ut te-
neantur, nou et homiues.

LX. Illud alibi quoque diximus, nullum tempus id effi· uetula
cere posse, ne luitio sit pignoris, si id prestetur, pro quo pig·
nus suppositum est. Nam qui actus causam veterem et notam
habet, non creditur ex nota procedere. Ideo patientia debi-

LVIII. This however may be added in passing: that sometimes
the hostages are not au accessory part of the obligatior, but really ι
principat part3 as when any ouo, by contract, promises something to
be done by another; and, that not being performed is held to the
amount of interest involved in the agreemeut3 then his hostaget are
bound in his plaee; which was the doctrino held in the Caudina eon·

· vention, as we have elsewhere stated. The opinion ot' those who hold
that hostages are bound for ouc another’s acts, eron without their own
consent, ishard and uujust.

LIX. Pledges hare some points iu comn u with hostages, some,
peculiar. It is common to the two, that being giren t‘or one thing,
they may be retained tor another, except a stipulation to the contrary
hare boen made. Audit is peculiur to Pledges, that the corenant
which is made concerning theru, is not to be taken so strictly aa that
concerning hostagcs: for things are made, to be held aa propertyt
men are not.

Lx. We hare also said elsewhere, that uo period of time can
supersede tho obligation of restoring the pledge, if that be done to
secure which tho pledge was depositod. For an act which has an old
and known rauseis not to bo believed to corne from a new one.
Therefore the forbearance of tho debtot· [who depositod the pledge]
