1. It is well said by J avolenus, that some things arc agreed upon in
silence. This happens inpublio conventione, and in private, andin mixed.
The cause is this3 that consent, however indicated and accepted, has
the force of transferring right. But there are other signs of consent,
besides words and letters, ns we bave mora than once indicated.

II. Some are bynature inherent in certain acts. For an example,
take him who coming fram the enemy, or from strangers, gives him-
selfinto the hands of another people or king. For that such a per·
son tacitly binde himself not to do anything against that state in which
he seeks refuge, cannot be doubted. Wherefare they are not to be
followed, who say that the act of Zopyrus nas free from blame: for
his tidelity to his king does not excuse his perfidy towards those to
whom he fied. The rame must be said of Sextum the same of Tar·
quin who went orer to Gabii. Virgil speaks of Sinon’s treachery and
cnme.
