what was done, and allowed it ιο ιι dous ι and in this case, if no other
reason [besides consent] can be probably assigned, we bevo elsewhere
stated what course the matter must talre. Τιο superior authorityare
obliged by the thing itsclf to this extent3 that they are ιιοι ιο be
made better off by the loss of other persons3 that is, that they are
either to tutet tho eontract by which they wieh to obtain an advantage,
or are to gire up the advantageJ a ease of equity which we haro
elsewhere discussed. And so fer, and no further, acts which are
performed so as to bring utility ιο us, are to be said to bo solid. On
ιιο οιιοι hand, they cannot be exeused from the charge of injusticc,
who, while they condemn the compact, retain that which without the
eompaet they would not bavo: as when the Roman Senate neither
could approre the act of Cn. Domitius, nor would rescind it: of which
kind of occurrence we have many in history.

IV. 1 We must also repeat what wo have said before, that he
who placed a person in a commend, is bound, even though the person
so placed acts against secret orders3 at least, within the limite of his
publio fonction. This rulo of equity was rightly followed by tho
Itomae Praetor, in the aetion against an Agent3 tor it is not ererything
done by the Agent which obliges the Principal,but such things only aa
areeontreeted in tho matter for which his agency was employed; but '
he concerning whom public notieo was giren, that eontraets with him
