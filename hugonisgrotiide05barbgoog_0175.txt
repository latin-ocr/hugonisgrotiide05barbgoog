hythe Thebansc which snm Alexander the (treet, haring oonqnered
Thebes, gave to them by the right oi victory3 nor is that true which
isalleged for tho Thebans in Quintilian: that that only belongs to the
vietor which he himself has in his hands3 and that an incorporeal right
cannot so be taken possession of: that the condition oi an heiris
different from thnt os a vietor, because to the former the right posses,
to the latter tho thing only. Forhe who is lord nithe persons, islord
of tho things also, ond ot all things which belong to the person He
who isin the possession oi another, has no possession ior himselft and
he who is not his own master, can be master of nothing else.

3 Eren it any victor leave to the conquered pcople the rights oi
their stato, ho may take to himself some things which belonged to the '
state: ior it depende on his own will what limit he chooses to fix to the
benefits which ho gives. Cesar imitated tho act of Alexander, in re·
mitting to the Dyrrachinos the dobt which they owed to some ot the

' adverse party. But hero it might bo objected that the war of Cesar
was not of that kind for which this law of natione was established.
