IX. 1 Iu the sume way, it is not tho business oi generals to gire up
men, conquesta, lands, obtained in war. By this rule, Syria was taken
from Tigranes, though Lucullus had giren it to him. Ol Sophonisba,
who had been taken prisoner in war, Scipio says that the judgment
und decision of the Senatu and Pcoplc of Rome was to determine3 and
that therefore Masinissa, though the gcucral by whom shc pas teleta
could not gire her liberty. That orer other things which are taken
as prizc of war, a certain ‹lisposal is concedcd tc persons in authority,
we hare scen; not so much from the force of their power, as from the

Ἰ customs of each people: on which subJ‘ect wc hare already spoken
sufficicntly. ⁶

2 Itis howercr in the power oi generals to gram the possession
of things not yet acquired: because towns sometimes and men often
surrendcr themselves in war, on condition of lires being spared, or
liberty, or property ς among which concessione generally, the state of
things does not allow the decision of the supreme authority to be

. nslred. And by purity of reason, this right is also giren to commandcrs
who are not the highest, within the limits ol the matters which are
committed to them to executa. blaharbal had giren to some Romans
who had escaped from the battle nt Trasimenum, Annibal being absent
